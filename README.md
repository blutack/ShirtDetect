Shirt Detection
=============

This is not my code, rather it is from [http://www.shervinemami.co.cc/shirtDetection.html](http://www.shervinemami.co.cc/shirtDetection.html)

I've cleaned it up to compile cleanly under GCC, and added a Makefile.
If you want a Visual Studio version visit the original site.
